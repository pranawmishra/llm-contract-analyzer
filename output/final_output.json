Subject to the terms hereof, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of any valid claim not more than ten (10) days after the Indemnified Party provides notice to the Indemnifying Party of such amount.(d) Right to Contest Claims of Third Persons. If an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder because of a claim asserted by any claimant (other than a Constellation Indemnified Person or HOF Entity Indemnified Person) (a Third Person ), the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt notice thereof after such assertion is actually known to the Indemnified Party provided, however, that the right of a person or entity to be indemnified hereunder in respect of claims made by a Third Person shall not be adversely affected by a failure to give such notice unless, and then only to the extent that, an Indemnifying Party is actually irrevocably and materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, and using counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, to investigate, contest or settle the claim alleged by such Third Person (a Third Person Claim ), provided that the Indemnifying Party has unconditionally acknowledged to the Indemnified Party in writing its obligation to indemnify the persons and entities to be indemnified hereunder with respect to such Third Person Claim and to discharge (and does in fact so discharge) any cost or expense arising out of such investigation, contest or settlement. The Indemnified Party may thereafter participate in (but not control) the defense of any such Third Person Claim with its own counsel at its own expense, unless separate representation is necessary to avoid a conflict of interest, in which case such representation shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. Unless and until the Indemnifying Party so acknowledges its obligation to indemnify, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its option, to assume and control defense of the matter and to look to the Indemnifying Party for the full amount of the reasonable costs of defense. The failure of the Indemnifying Party to respond in writing to the aforesaid notice of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Person Claim within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof shall be deemed an irrevocable election not to defend the same. If the Indemnifying Party does not so acknowledge its obligation to indemnify and assume the defense of any such Third Person Claim, (i) the Indemnified Party may defend against such claim using counsel of its choice, in such manner as it may reasonably deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, settling such claim, after giving notice of the same to the Indemnifying Party, on such terms as the Indemnified Party may reasonably deem appropriate, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party may participate in (but not control) the defense of such action, with its own counsel at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party thereafter seeks to question the manner in which the Indemnified Party defended such Third Person Claim or the amount or nature of any such settlement, the Indemnifying Party shall have the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that conduct of the Indemnified Party in the defense and/or settlement of such Third Person Claim constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Parties shall make available to each other all relevant information in their possession relating to any such Third Person Claim and shall cooperate in the defense thereof."

(c) In case any claim, action or proceeding (including any governmental investigation) is instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 13.9(a) or 13.9(b), such person (the Indemnified Party ) will promptly, but in any event within 10 Business Days, notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the Indemnifying Party ) in writing, and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, and to the extent the Indemnifying Party so desires, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party provided, that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice within the time limit provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under Section 13.9(a) or 13.9(b), except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced by such failure to give notice. In any such claim, action or proceeding where the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in any such defense and to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel will be at the expense of such Indemnified Party unless the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party have been advised by counsel that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicting interests between them. It is understood that the Indemnifying Party will not, in connection with any claim, action or proceeding or related claims, actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at any time for all such Indemnified Parties and that all such reasonable fees and expenses will be reimbursed as they are incurred.

No Indemnifying Party will, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is seeking indemnity hereunder, unless such settlement includes (i) an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability in connection with such proceeding, (ii) no finding or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights of any person by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates can be made as the result of such action, and (iii) the sole relief (if any) provided is monetary damages that are reimbursed in full by the Indemnifying Party. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 13.9 from the Indemnifying Party is unavailable to an Indemnified Party hereunder or is insufficient in respect of any Losses referred to in this Section 13.9, then the Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, will contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such Losses (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the actions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative fault referred to in clause (i) but also the relative benefit of Moelis Holdings, on the one hand, and each SMBC Unit-Holder, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations provided, however, that in no event shall a SMBC Unit-Holder be required by this Section 13.9(d) to contribute an aggregate amount in excess of the dollar amount of proceeds (net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other selling expenses) received by such SMBC Unit-Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities giving rise to such contribution. The relative fault of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party will be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been taken by, or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the Losses referred to above will be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 13.9(c), any reasonable out of pocket legal or other out of pocket fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. (e) The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to Section 13.9(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in Section 13.9(d). No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 13.9(e), a SMBC Unit-Holder shall not be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received by such SMBC Unit-Holder from the sale of the Registrable Securities exceeds the amount of any damages which such SMBC Unit-Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. (f) If indemnification is available under this Section 13.9, the Indemnifying Party will indemnify each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law provided in Sections 13.9(a) and 13.9(b) without regard to the relative fault of said Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party or any other equitable consideration provided for in Section 13.9(d) or 13.9(e). The obligations of Moelis Holdings under this Section 13.9 shall be in addition to any liability that Moelis Holdings may otherwise have to any Indemnified Person. (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of the Indemnified Parties has relied on this Section 13.9, is an express third party beneficiary of this Section 13.9 and is entitled to enforce the obligations of the applicable Indemnified Parties under this Section 13.9 directly against such Indemnified Parties to the full extent thereof."

We may, in our sole judgment, take such actions as we deem necessary and appropriate to investigate, defend, or settle any event or take other remedial or corrective actions with respect thereto as may be, in our sole judgment, necessary for the protection of the Indemnitees or the System. You shall defend us and each of our affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, agents, and employees named in any lawsuit based on such loss or expenses and shall pay all costs and reasonable attorneys fees associated with such defense. If we wish to retain our own counsel to defend any such action, you shall reimburse us for all reasonable costs and legal fees incurred by us for such defense. Said reimbursement shall be made to us in a timely manner upon demand as such fees are incurred by us and billed to you. In addition to the foregoing, upon termination of this Agreement by us for cause as described in Section 10, you agree to pay to us within fifteen (15) days after the effective date of this Agreement s termination, in addition to the amounts owed hereunder, liquidated damages equal to the average monthly Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee and Franchise Sales Royalty Fee you paid during the twelve (12) months of operation preceding the effective date of termination multiplied by (a) twenty-four (24) (being the number of months in two (2) full years), or (b) the number of months remaining in the Agreement had it not been terminated, whichever is lower. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that it would be impracticable to determine precisely the damages we would incur from this Agreement s termination and the loss of cash flow from Royalty Fees due to, among other things, the complications of determining what costs, if any, we might have saved and how much the Royalty Fees would have grown over what would have been this Agreement s remaining term. The parties hereto consider this liquidated damages provision to be a reasonable, good faith pre-estimate of those damages. The liquidated damages provision only covers our damages from the loss of cash flow from the Royalty Fees. It does not cover any other damages, including damages to our reputation with the public and landlords and damages arising from a violation of any provision of this Agreement other than the Royalty Fee sections. You and each of your principals agree that the liquidated damages provision does not give us an adequate remedy at law for any default under, or for the enforcement of, any provision of this Agreement other than the Royalty Fee sections. We and you, and our respective directors, officers, shareholders and guarantors, as applicable, each hereby waive to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right to, or claim for, punitive or exemplary damages against the other and agree that, in the event of a dispute between them, each is limited to recovering only the actual damages proven to have been sustained by it."

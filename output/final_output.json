The failure to give such notice will relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has suffered actual prejudice thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall assume and control the defense and settlement of any such action, suit or proceeding at its own expense. The Indemnified Party shall, if requested by the Indemnifying Party, cooperate in all reasonable respects in such defense, at the Indemnifying Party s expense. The Indemnified Party will be entitled at its own expense to participate in such defense and to employ separate counsel for such purpose. For so long as the Indemnifying Party is diligently defending any proceeding pursuant to this Section 11.3, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable under Section 11.1 or 11.2, as applicable, for any settlement effected without its consent. No Party shall enter into any compromise or settlement which commits the other Party to take, or to forbear to take, any action without the other Party s prior written consent (and unless such compromise or settlement includes no payments by the Indemnified Party, an unconditional release of, and no admission of liability by, the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Claim). 11.4 Limitation of Liability.

THE FOREGOING SENTENCE SHALL NOT LIMIT (1) THE OBLIGATIONS OF EITHER PARTY TO INDEMNIFY THE OTHER PARTY FROM AND AGAINST THIRD PARTY CLAIMS UNDER SECTION 11.1 OR 11.2, AS APPLICABLE, OR (2) DAMAGES AVAILABLE FOR A PARTY S BREACH OF THE CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-USE OBLIGATIONS IN ARTICLE 9. 11.5 Insurance. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that during the Term, it shall maintain, through purchase or self-insurance, adequate insurance, including products liability coverage and comprehensive general liability insurance, adequate to cover its obligations under this Agreement and which are consistent with normal business practices of prudent companies similarly situated.

Dova does not and will not maintain or procure any worker s compensation, healthcare, or other insurance for or on behalf of any Field Force Personnel, all of which shall be Valeant s sole responsibility.

(c) In case any claim, action or proceeding (including any governmental investigation) is instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 13.9(a) or 13.9(b), such person (the Indemnified Party ) will promptly, but in any event within 10 Business Days, notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the Indemnifying Party ) in writing, and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, and to the extent the Indemnifying Party so desires, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party provided, that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice within the time limit provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under Section 13.9(a) or 13.9(b), except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced by such failure to give notice. In any such claim, action or proceeding where the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in any such defense and to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel will be at the expense of such Indemnified Party unless the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party have been advised by counsel that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicting interests between them.

No Indemnifying Party will, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is seeking indemnity hereunder, unless such settlement includes (i) an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability in connection with such proceeding, (ii) no finding or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights of any person by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates can be made as the result of such action, and (iii) the sole relief (if any) provided is monetary damages that are reimbursed in full by the Indemnifying Party.

The relative fault of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party will be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been taken by, or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the Losses referred to above will be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 13.9(c), any reasonable out of pocket legal or other out of pocket fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. (e) The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to Section 13.9(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in Section 13.9(d). No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 13.9(e), a SMBC Unit-Holder shall not be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received by such SMBC Unit-Holder from the sale of the Registrable Securities exceeds the amount of any damages which such SMBC Unit-Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. (f) If indemnification is available under this Section 13.9, the Indemnifying Party will indemnify each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law provided in Sections 13.9(a) and 13.9(b) without regard to the relative fault of said Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party or any other equitable consideration provided for in Section 13.9(d) or 13.9(e). The obligations of Moelis Holdings under this Section 13.9 shall be in addition to any liability that Moelis Holdings may otherwise have to any Indemnified Person. (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of the Indemnified Parties has relied on this Section 13.9, is an express third party beneficiary of this Section 13.9 and is entitled to enforce the obligations of the applicable Indemnified Parties under this Section 13.9 directly against such Indemnified Parties to the full extent thereof."

The parties hereto consider this liquidated damages provision to be a reasonable, good faith pre-estimate of those damages.11.4.4 The liquidated damages provision only covers our damages from the loss of cash flow from the Royalty Fees. It does not cover any other damages, including damages to our reputation with the public and landlords and damages arising from a violation of any provision of this Agreement other than the Royalty Fee sections.

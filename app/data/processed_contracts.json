February 5, 2020 Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: AIMT), a biopharmaceutical company developing treatments for\npotentially life-threatening food allergies, today announced it has obtained an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize the\ninvestigational humanized monoclonal antibody Xm Ab 7195 from Xencor, Inc.\nXm Ab 7195, which has been renamed AIMab 7195, was originally developed by Xencor for the treatment of allergic asthma. It uses three distinct\nmechanisms of action to reduce blood serum Ig E and suppress Ig E-producing cells. Aimmune initially plans to develop AIMab 7195 as an adjunctive\ntreatment with select Characterized Oral Desensitized Immuno Therapy (CODIT ) programs, including PALFORZIA , to explore treatment outcomes in\npatients with food allergies.\n As we look to the future of food allergy treatments, we are excited to explore the potential of oral immunotherapy to achieve greater levels of\ndesensitization and perhaps even remission when combined with adjunctive biologics that target immune pathways, said Jayson Dallas, M.D.,\nPresident and CEO of Aimmune. In-licensing AIMab 7195 demonstrates our commitment to enriching our pipeline and strengthening Aimmune s global\nleadership in the evolving therapeutic landscape of food allergy treatments. \n Aimmune s focus, clinical success and regulatory expertise in food allergy demonstrate their capability to advance AIMab 7195 with highly\ncomplementary CODIT pipeline programs to create new options for people living with food allergy, said Bassil Dahiyat, Ph.D., President and CEO of\nXencor. AIMab 7195 is designed to reduce levels of Ig E, a key mediator of allergic response, and there is strong scientific rationale that this reduction\nwould synergize with the activity of desensitization therapies. \nUnder the terms of the agreement, Aimmune will make an upfront payment to Xencor of [AMOUNT] million in cash and [AMOUNT] million in equity, equivalent to 156,238\nnewly issued shares of Aimmune common stock at [AMOUNT]/share. Xencor also is eligible to receive up to [AMOUNT] million based on the achievement of\ncertain clinical development, regulatory and commercialization milestones beginning with the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial and is eligible to\nreceive a high single-digit to mid-teen percentage of royalties upon commercialization of AIMab 7195. Aimmune will be solely responsible for costs related\nto the development of AIMab 7195 and plans to provide a development plan in the coming months.\nAbout AIMab 7195 (formerly Xm Ab 7195)\nAIMab 7195 is an anti-Ig E monoclonal antibody with enhanced binding to the Fc gamma receptor IIb (Fcy RIIb). Ig E recognizes and interacts with\nallergens and, as a result, can activate immune cells, such as mast cells and basophils, that drive an allergic response\nSource: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, [DATE]\n--  --\nin patients. AIMab 7195 is designed to clear Ig E rapidly from circulation, to prevent the production of Ig E by preventing the activation of Ig E-positive B\ncells, and to block Ig E from interacting with its receptor on immune cells. AIMab 7195 has been evaluated in two Phase 1 studies that enrolled more than\n100 healthy volunteers and patients with allergy and atopic disease.\nAbout Aimmune\nAimmune Therapeutics, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company that aspires to become the global leader in developing curative therapies and solutions for\npatients with food allergies. With a mission to improve the lives of people with food allergies, Aimmune is developing and commercializing oral treatments\nfor potentially life-threatening food allergies. The Company s Characterized Oral Desensitization Immuno Therapy (CODIT ) approach is intended to\nprovide meaningful levels of protection against allergic reactions resulting from accidental exposure to food allergens by desensitizing patients with\ndefined, precise amounts of key allergens. Aimmune has one FDA-approved medicine for peanut allergy and other investigational therapies in\ndevelopment to treat other food allergies.

The responsive website will be\nuploaded and deployed into an AWS Environment also registered to the client.\nThe applications and responsive website will be fed by a Ruby on Rails backend with the according API. The API will be open to be used in other\nsports betting platforms.\nThe app will be developed under the following considerations:\n \nNative i OS Swift 5.0 Language with Xcode Development Environment.\n \nNative JAVA with Android Studio for Android Devices with OS 6.0+\n \nRuby On Rails Backend + Postgre SQL + Rest API\n \nHTML 5 + CSS 3 + Bootstrap\nCore Platform\nThe Core of Click Stream is a free to play gaming platform that caters untapped market of the causal users that will spend a few seconds to interact\nwith a platform for free in order to win real money.\nOur primary target is not the sports betters or the fantasy players.

Our winners are\nmore top loaded and pay out around [AMOUNT] per the top 5 and [AMOUNT] per the top 10.\nInitially monetization is based upon sponsors paying out the pots. IE, a pot for a single game will be around [AMOUNT] to the winners and Sponsors\nwill pay around [AMOUNT] to [AMOUNT] to sponsor the event.

A COMPLETE VERSION OF THIS EXHIBIT HAS BEEN FILED\nSEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.\nSource: DOVA PHARMACEUTICALS INC., 10-Q, [DATE]\n--  --\nEXHIBIT A\nJoint Press Release\nDURHAM, N.C. and BRIDGEWATER, N.J., Sept. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Dova )\n(DOVA), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring, developing, and commercializing drug candidates for diseases\nwhere there is a high unmet need, and Salix Pharmaceuticals ( Salix ), one of the largest specialty pharmaceutical companies in the\nworld committed to the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases and its parent company, Bausch Health Companies\nInc. (NYSE/TSX: BHC), today announced that they have entered into an exclusive agreement to co-promote Dova s\nDOPTELET (avatrombopag) in the United States (U.S.). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") approved\nDOPTELET on May 21, 2018 for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) who are\nscheduled to undergo a procedure. DOPTELET represents the first thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist approved in the\nUnited States for this indication.\nThrombocytopenia, a condition in which patients have a low platelet count, is the most common hematological abnormality in\npatients with CLD that often worsens with the severity of liver disease. It is estimated that approximately 15 percent of the 7.5\nmillion patients with CLD have some form of thrombocytopenia. In a study published in 2010, patients with severe\nthrombocytopenia (<75,000/ L) had a 31 percent incidence of procedure-related bleeding. As a result of the associated increased\nrate of bleeding, there is an increased risk for the CLD patient when undergoing common scheduled medical procedures such as\nliver biopsy, colonoscopy, endoscopy, and routine dental procedures.\nAs part of the co-promotion arrangement, Salix intends to deploy approximately 100 sales specialists who will promote\nDOPTELET to gastroenterology healthcare professionals. The Salix sales force will begin selling DOPTELET in mid-October\n2018. Dova will continue its commercial efforts targeting primarily hepatologists and interventional radiologists and certain other\nspecialties. Pursuant to the agreement, Dova will pay Salix a quarterly fee based on net sales (as defined in the agreement) of\nDOPTELET prescribed by gastroenterologists in the U.S.\n We are delighted to be working with Salix, a company considered by many to have the preeminent gastroenterology sales force in\nthe United States, said Alex C. Sapir, president and chief executive officer, Dova Pharmaceuticals. Given Salix s presence and\nstrong reputation within large gastroenterology group practices coupled with the early interest we are seeing among the\ngastroenterology community, we are excited to see the impact this partnership will bring to DOPTELET and to patients. \n Salix considers liver disease a strategic therapeutic area of focus, given our history and knowledge with XIFAXAN (rifaximin),\nan innovative medicine indicated for the treatment of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a condition that is often a consequence of\nchronic liver disease, said Mark Mc Kenna, president, Salix Pharmaceuticals. Adding DOPTELET to our portfolio will enable\nour sales force to promote yet another innovative product that addresses a true unmet need in the marketplace. \nCONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED FOR PORTIONS OF THIS EXHIBIT.

A COMPLETE VERSION OF THIS EXHIBIT HAS BEEN FILED\nSEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.\nSource: DOVA PHARMACEUTICALS INC., 10-Q, [DATE]\n--  --\nAbout DOPTELET \nDOPTELET (avatrombopag) is a second generation, once daily, orally administered TPO receptor agonist approved for the\ntreatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with CLD who are scheduled to undergo a procedure. DOPTELET is designed to\nmimic the effects of TPO, the primary regulator of normal platelet production.\nTwo global Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (ADAPT-1 [N=231] and ADAPT-2 [N=204]), conducted in adults\nwith thrombocytopenia (platelet count of less than 50,000/ L) and CLD, supported the FDA approval. Patients were assigned to\neither 40 mg or 60 mg of avatrombopag daily for five days based on their Baseline platelet counts (40 to <50,000/ m L or\n<40,000/ m L, respectively). Avatrombopag was shown to be superior to placebo in increasing the proportion of patients not\nrequiring platelet transfusions or rescue procedures for bleeding up to seven days following a scheduled procedure in both trials in\nboth the 40 mg (ADAPT-1, 88% vs. 38%, p <0.0001 ADAPT-2, 88% vs. 33% p<0.0001), and 60 mg (ADAPT-1, 66% vs.\n23%, p <0.0001 ADAPT-2, 69% vs. 35% p=0.0006) treatment groups. Avatrombopag was also superior to placebo at the two\nsecondary efficacy endpoints in each trial. In the avatrombopag treatment groups, there was an increased proportion of patients\nachieving the target platelet count of 50,000/ m L on procedure day, and a greater magnitude of the change in mean platelet count\nfrom baseline to procedure day all treatment differences between the avatrombopag and placebo treatment groups for each\nsecondary endpoint were highly statistically significant with p values <0.0001. The most common adverse reactions with\navatrombopag included pyrexia, abdominal pain, nausea, headache, fatigue and edema peripheral. Portal vein thromboses have\nbeen reported in patients with CLD and in patients receiving TPO receptor agonists. One treatment-emergent event of portal vein\nthrombosis was reported in the ADAPT trials in an avatrombopag-treated patient.\nINDICATION\nDOPTELET (avatrombopag) is indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease who\nare scheduled to undergo a procedure.\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\nDOPTELET is a thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist and TPO receptor agonists have been associated with thrombotic and\nthromboembolic complications in patients with chronic liver disease. Portal vein thrombosis has been reported in patients with\nchronic liver disease treated with TPO receptor agonists. In the ADAPT-1 and ADAPT-2 clinical trials, there was one treatment-\nemergent event of portal vein thrombosis in a patient (n=1/430) with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia treated with\nDOPTELET.\nConsider the potential increased thrombotic risk when administering DOPTELET to patients with known risk factors for\nthromboembolism, including genetic prothrombotic conditions (Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin 20210 A, Antithrombin deficiency or\nProtein C or S deficiency).\nDOPTELET should not be administered to patients with chronic liver disease in an attempt to normalize platelet counts.\nCONTRAINDICATIONS: None\nCONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED FOR PORTIONS OF THIS EXHIBIT.

It has been proven to reduce the risk of overt HE recurrence and HE-related hospitalizations\nin adults.\n*There is an increased systemic exposure in patients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment. Caution should be\nexercised when administering XIFAXAN to these patients.\nINDICATION \nXIFAXAN (rifaximin) 550 mg tablets are indicated for the reduction in risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) recurrence in\nadults and for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) in adults.\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n XIFAXAN is not for everyone. Do not take XIFAXAN if you have a known hypersensitivity to rifaximin, any of the rifamycin\nantimicrobial agents, or any of the components in XIFAXAN.\n If you take antibiotics, like XIFAXAN, there is a chance you could experience diarrhea caused by an overgrowth of bacteria (C.\ndifficile). This can cause symptoms ranging in severity from mild diarrhea to life-threatening colitis. Contact your healthcare\nprovider if your diarrhea does not improve or worsens.\n Talk to your healthcare provider before taking XIFAXAN if you have severe hepatic (liver) impairment, as this may cause\nincreased effects of the medicine.\n Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking drugs called P-glycoprotein and/or OATPs inhibitors (such as cyclosporine)\nbecause using these drugs with XIFAXAN may lead to an increase in the amount of XIFAXAN absorbed by your body.\n In clinical studies, the most common side effects of XIFAXAN were:\nHE: Peripheral edema (swelling, usually in the ankles or lower limbs), nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), dizziness, fatigue\n(feeling tired), and ascites (a buildup of fluid in the abdomen) \nIBS-D: Nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) and an increase in liver enzymes\n XIFAXAN may affect warfarin activity when taken together. Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking warfarin because the\ndose of warfarin may need to be adjusted to maintain proper blood-thinning effect.\n If you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or nursing, talk to your healthcare provider before taking XIFAXAN because\nXIFAXAN may cause harm to an unborn baby or nursing infant.\nYou are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-\nFDA-1088.\nCONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED FOR PORTIONS OF THIS EXHIBIT.

Developer understands and acknowledges that in accepting Developer s proposed site or by\ngranting a franchise for each approved site, Franchisor does not in any way, endorse, warrant or guarantee either\ndirectly or indirectly the suitability of such site or the success of the franchise business to be operated by\nDeveloper at such site. The suitability of the site and the success of the franchise business depend upon a number\nof factors outside of Franchisor s control, including, but not limited to, the Developer s operational abilities, site\nlocation, consumer trends and such other factors that are within the direct control of the Developer.\nSource: EL POLLO LOCO HOLDINGS, INC., 10-K, [DATE]\n--  --\n2.19. The purpose of this Agreement is to promote orderly incremental growth within the El Pollo Loco \nSystem. The acquisition of existing El Pollo Loco restaurants by Developer does not represent incremental\ngrowth and, therefore, does not satisfy the terms of this Agreement pertaining to development.\n2.20. (To be added where there are existing restaurants in the Territory) Developer acknowledges\nthat Franchisor (i) is operating or has franchised another to operate, one (1) or more restaurants in the\nTerritory or (ii) has granted franchise rights to another in the Territory or (iii) approved a new site for\ndevelopment for those locations identified in Exhibit C attached hereto and incorporated herein by this\nreference. Developer further acknowledges that Franchisor retains the sole and absolute right to\napprove or disapprove any proposed location for development under this Agreement if, in Franchisor s\nreasonable judgment: (i) such proposed location is not suitable for an El Pollo Loco Restaurant or (ii)\nsuch proposed location will have a material adverse effect on the profitability of another existing El Pollo\nLoco location (or approved site) in the Territory. Developer covenants to use its reasonable best efforts\nto avoid selecting proposed locations that would adversely impact pre-existing locations in the Territory.\n3. Development Fee.\n3.1. Developer shall pay to Franchisor upon execution of this Agreement a non-refundable Development\nFee (the Development Fee ) equal to Twenty Thousand Dollars ([AMOUNT]) in immediately available funds, for\neach El Pollo Loco Restaurant to be developed under this Agreement. The Development Fee is consideration for\nthis Agreement. The Development Fee is not consideration for any Franchise Agreement and is non-refundable.\nThe [AMOUNT] Development Fee for each El Pollo Loco Restaurant shall be applied against the initial franchise fee\npayable upon the execution of the Franchise Agreement applicable to such El Pollo Loco Restaurant. As a\nbenefit of signing the Development Agreement, the Initial Fee for the second and each subsequent restaurant\ndeveloped under the same Development Agreement will be reduced by us to [AMOUNT] As an example, the Initial\nFee for the first restaurant developed under a Development Agreement would be [AMOUNT] to which [AMOUNT] (from\nthe Development Fee will be credited. The Initial Fee for the second and remaining restaurants developed under\nthe same Development Agreement would be [AMOUNT] to which [AMOUNT] from the Development Fee will be\ncredited. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 10 or 11 below, Developer will lose its right to\ndevelop and Development Fee.\n4. Term of Development Agreement.\n4.1.

Territory Conflicts.\n5.1. The rights granted Developer in this Agreement are subject to any prior territorial rights of other\nfranchisees which may now exist in the Territory, whether or not those rights are currently being enforced. In the\nevent of a conflict in territorial rights, whether under a Franchise Agreement or separate territorial or development\nagreement, Developer shall be free to negotiate with any person, corporation or other entity, which claims territorial\nrights adverse to the rights granted under this Agreement, for the assignment of those prior territorial rights. For\nthis purpose, Franchisor agrees to approve any such assignment not in conflict with the other terms of this\nAgreement, subject to the condition of any Franchise Agreements involved, and current policies pertaining to\nassignments, including, but not limited to, satisfaction of all past due debts owed to Franchisor and the execution\nof a General Release.\n5.2. In the event of third party claims of the right to develop the Territory, it is the sole responsibility of El\nPollo Loco, where the right granted herein is exclusive, to protect and maintain Developer's right to the\ndevelopment of the Territory. However, if it appears to El Pollo Loco, as its sole and absolute right to determine,\nthat protection of the Territory by legal action is not advisable, whether due to the anticipation of, or the actual\nprotracted nature of the action, the costs involved, the uncertainty of outcome, or otherwise, Franchisor has the\nright to terminate this Agreement, provided that it refunds to Developer the balance, if any, of the Development Fee\nmade pursuant to Section 3, which has not been applied against the initial franchise fees for Franchise\nAgreement(s) to be acquired under this Agreement.\n6.

This Agreement is not a Franchise\nAgreement. Developer may not open an El Pollo Loco Restaurant or use the El Pollo Loco Marks at a particular\nsite until it executes a Franchise Agreement for that site. Developer's use of the El Pollo Loco Marks shall be\nlimited to those rights granted under each individual Franchise Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, El Pollo\nLoco may authorize Developer in writing to use the Marks in connection with advertising and marketing activities\nin connection with this Agreement. Developer expressly agrees that such usage is limited to those specific\nactivities or promotional materials approved by El Pollo Loco s marketing department in advance. Developer\nfurther agrees that its use of the Marks shall not create in its favor any right, title, or interest in or to El Pollo Loco \nMarks, but that all of such use shall inure to the benefit of El Pollo Loco, and Developer has no rights to the Marks\nexcept to the degree specifically granted by the individual Franchise Agreement(s). Building designs and\nspecifications, color schemes and combinations, sign design specifications, and interior building layouts\n(including equipment, equipment specification, equipment layouts, and interior color schemes and combinations)\nare acknowledged by Developer to comprise part of the El Pollo Loco System.

Developer recognizes the unique value and secondary meaning attached to the El\nPollo Loco Marks and the El Pollo Loco System, and Developer agrees that any noncompliance with the terms\nof this Agreement or any unauthorized or improper use will cause irreparable damage to Franchisor and its\nfranchisees. Developer, therefore, agrees that if it should engage in any such unauthorized or improper use during,\nor after, the term of this Agreement, Franchisor shall be entitled to both seek temporary and permanent injunctive\nrelief from any court of competent jurisdiction in addition to any other remedies prescribed by law.\n6.3.

All policies shall provide Franchisor\nwith at least thirty (30) days notice of cancellation or termination of coverage.\n7.3. Franchisor reserves the right to specify reasonable changes in the types and amounts of insurance\ncoverage required by this Section 7.

In such event, Developer\nshall pay the required premiums or reimburse such premiums to Franchisor upon written demand.\n7.4.

Developer further\nagrees that Developer s duty to defend the Franchisor is separate from, independent of and free-standing of\nDeveloper s duty to indemnify the Franchisor and applies whether the issue of Developer s negligence, breach of\ncontract, or other fault or obligation has been determined. Developer s duty to defend is regardless of the outcome\nof liability even if Developer is ultimately found not negligent and not dependent on the ultimate resolution of issues\narising out of any claims, lawsuits, complaints, cross complaints, arbitration, demands, allegations, costs\nembraced by indemnity, loss, costs, expenses (including attorneys fees), liens or damages.\n7.5.

The provisions of this Section 7 shall expire as to each El Pollo Loco Restaurant to be developed\nunder this Agreement upon execution of a Franchise Agreement for such El Pollo Loco Restaurant.

All other entity structures shall require the prior written approval of Franchisor.\nDeveloper shall pay an administrative fee of Five Hundred Dollars ([AMOUNT]) per transfer for each permitted transfer\nto an Entity where such transfer is for the convenience of ownership only and does not involve a change of\nprincipals of the business.

Within 60 days\nafter Moelis Holdings receives a written notice to register the Registrable Securities, Moelis Holdings will\n \n18\n--  --\n \nfile a Registration Statement, on an appropriate form, to register the sale of the Registrable Securities, which Registration\nStatement will (if specified in the SMBC Unit-Holders notice) contemplate the ability of the SMBC Unit-Holders to effect an\nUnderwritten Offering (the Demand Registration ). The Demand Notice shall specify the intended method of distribution of the\nRegistrable Securities. Subject to Section 13.2, Moelis Holdings may include in any registration effected pursuant to this Section\n13.1 any securities for its own account or for the account of holders (other than the SMBC Unit-Holders) of Partnership Interests \nprovided, that, Moelis Holdings shall pay a portion of all expenses of Moelis Holdings (including those set forth in Section 13.8)\nin connection with any such registration, in proportion to the aggregate selling price of all securities so included in any such\nregistration.\n \n(ii) Moelis Holdings will use its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to cause any Registration Statement to be declared\neffective (unless it becomes effective automatically upon filing) as promptly as practicable after the filing thereof with the SEC\nand (ii) to keep such Registration Statement current and effective for a period of 90 days, or such shorter time necessary for the\ncompletion of the sale of Registrable Securities registered thereon. Moelis Holdings further agrees to use its commercially\nreasonable efforts to supplement or make amendments to such Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep such\nRegistration Statement effective for the period referred to in clause (ii) above, including (A) to respond to the comments of the\nSEC, if any, (B) as may be required by the registration form utilized by Moelis Holdings for such Registration Statement or by the\ninstructions to such registration form, (C) as may be required by the Securities Act, or (D) as may reasonably be requested in\nwriting by the SMBC Unit-Holders or any underwriter and acceptable to Moelis Holdings. Moelis Holdings agrees to furnish to\nthe SMBC Unit-Holders copies of any such supplement or amendment no later than the time it is first used or filed with the SEC.\n \n(b) If the Demand Notice specifies that the Registrable Securities will be sold in an Underwritten Offering, the parties shall\nmutually agree on the lead underwriter and any additional underwriters.\n \n(c) Any registration initiated pursuant to Section 13.1(a) shall not count as a Demand Registration (i) unless and until the\nRegistration Statement with respect to the Registrable Securities has become effective and remained effective for a period of 90 days or, if a shorter\ntime, until all of the Registrable Securities have been sold, or (ii) if the conditions to closing specified in the underwriting agreement, if any, entered\ninto in connection with such registration are not satisfied or waived, other than by reason of a failure on the part of the SMBC Unit-Holders.\n \n13.2 Piggyback Registration. If Moelis Holdings proposes to file a registration statement under the Securities Act (other than non-\nparticipating, non-convertible debt or\n \n19\n--  --\n \nequity securities or securities to be issued pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-4 or S-8 or any comparable form) for its own account or\nfor the account of a holder (other than the SMBC Unit-Holders) of Partnership Interests, including in connection with the IPO and where SMB\nC/Nikko (including an SMBC Unit-Holder) has the right to sell any or all SMBC Units under this Agreement, then Moelis Holdings shall give\nwritten notice of such proposed filing to the SMBC Unit-Holders as soon as commercially practicable but in no event less than (i) 20 days before\nthe anticipated filing date or (ii) if Moelis Holdings determines to conduct a registration less than 20 days before the anticipated filing date, then on\nthe date Moelis Holdings determines to proceed with such registration (a Piggyback Registration ). If Moelis Holdings proposes to file the\nregistration statement before the termination of the Strategic Alliance, the written notice to the SMBC Unit-Holders shall include the number of\nPartnership Interests to be sold by KM and the percentage of the total Partnership Interests held by KM represented by that number. Within 10\ndays after delivery of any such notice by Moelis Holdings, or such shorter period as Moelis Holdings specifies in such notice if Moelis Holdings\ndetermines to conduct a registration less than 10 days before the anticipated filing date, the SMBC Unit-Holders may request in writing that Moelis\nHoldings include any Registrable Securities held by the SMBC Unit-Holders in the proposed registration.

The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the Losses referred to above will be deemed to include, subject to the\nlimitations set forth in Section 13.9(c), any reasonable out of pocket legal or other out of pocket fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party\nin connection with any investigation or proceeding.\n \n(e) The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to Section 13.9(d) were determined by pro\nrata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in Section 13.9(d). No\nperson guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any\nperson who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 13.9(e), a SMBC Unit-Holder shall\nnot be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received by such SMBC Unit-Holder\nfrom the sale of the Registrable Securities exceeds the amount of any damages which such SMBC Unit-Holder has otherwise been required to pay\nby reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.\n \n28\n--  --\n \n(f) If indemnification is available under this Section 13.9, the Indemnifying Party will indemnify each Indemnified Party to the\nfullest extent permissible under applicable law provided in Sections 13.9(a) and 13.9(b) without regard to the relative fault of said Indemnifying Party\nor Indemnified Party or any other equitable consideration provided for in Section 13.9(d) or 13.9(e). The obligations of Moelis Holdings under this\nSection 13.9 shall be in addition to any liability that Moelis Holdings may otherwise have to any Indemnified Person.\n \n(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of the Indemnified Parties has relied on this Section 13.9, is\nan express third party beneficiary of this Section 13.9 and is entitled to enforce the obligations of the applicable Indemnified Parties under this\nSection 13.9 directly against such Indemnified Parties to the full extent thereof.\n \n13.10 Rule 144.

All indemnification claims in respect of any Sanofi Indemnitee or Rev Med Indemnitee seeking indemnity under Section 14.1 or\nSection 14.2 (collectively, the Indemnitees and each an Indemnitee ) will be made solely by the corresponding Party (the Indemnified Party ). The\nIndemnified Party will give the indemnifying Party (the Indemnifying Party ) prompt written notice (an Indemnification Claim Notice ) of any Losses\nor discovery of fact upon which such Indemnified Party intends to base a request for indemnification under Section 14.1 or Section 14.2, but failure to\nprovide prompt notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from its obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder except to the extent any Losses\nresult from such delay in providing such notice. Each Indemnification Claim Notice must contain a description of the claim and the nature and amount of\nsuch Loss (to the extent that the nature and amount of such Loss are known at such time). Together with the Indemnification Claim Notice, the\nIndemnified Party will furnish promptly to the Indemnifying Party copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by any\nIndemnitee in connection with the Third Party Claim.\n(b) Control of Defense. At its option, the Indemnifying Party may assume the defense of any Third Party Claim subject to indemnification as\nprovided for in Section 14.1 or Section 14.2 by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party within [***] after the Indemnifying Party s receipt of an\nIndemnification Claim Notice. Upon assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may select and appoint the lead legal counsel for\nthe defense of the Third Party Claim. Should the Indemnifying Party assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable\nto the Indemnified Party or any other Indemnitee for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party or other Indemnitee in\nconnection with the analysis, defense or settlement of the Third Party Claim.\n72\nSource: REVOLUTION MEDICINES, INC., S-1, [DATE]\n--  --\n(c) Right to Participate in Defense.

With respect to any Losses relating solely to the payment of money damages in connection with a Third Party Claim and that will\nnot result in the Indemnitee s becoming subject to injunctive or other relief or otherwise adversely affect the business of the Indemnitee in any manner,\nand as to which the Indemnifying Party has acknowledged in writing the obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder, the Indemnifying Party will\nhave the sole right to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss, on such terms as the\nIndemnifying Party, in its sole discretion, will deem appropriate. The Indemnifying Party will pay all amounts on behalf of the Indemnified Party at or prior\nto the time of the entry of judgment. With respect to all other Losses in connection with Third Party Claims, where the Indemnifying Party has assumed\nthe defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 14.3(b), the Indemnifying Party will have authority to consent to the entry of any\njudgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss provided it obtains the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which\nconsent will be at the Indemnified Party s sole and absolute discretion). The Indemnifying Party that has assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim in\naccordance with Section 14.3(b) will not be liable for any settlement or other disposition of a Loss by an Indemnitee that is reached without the written\nconsent of such Indemnifying Party. Regardless of whether the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, no Indemnitee will admit\nany liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third Party Claim without first offering to the Indemnifying Party the opportunity to\nassume the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 14.3(b).\n(e) Cooperation. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will, and will cause each other\nIndemnitee to, cooperate in the defense thereof and will furnish such records, information and testimony, provide such witnesses and attend such\nconferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested in connection with the defense of such Third Party\nClaim. Such cooperation will include access during normal business hours afforded to the Indemnifying Party to, and reasonable retention by the\nIndemnified Party of, records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making Indemnitees and other employees and\nagents available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Indemnifying\nParty will reimburse the Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket costs in connection with such cooperation.\n(f) Expenses. Except as provided above, the reasonable and verifiable costs and expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, incurred\nby the Indemnified Party in connection with any claim will be reimbursed on a [***] by the Indemnifying Party, without prejudice to the Indemnifying\nParty s right to contest the Indemnified Party s right to indemnification and subject to refund in the event the Indemnifying Party is ultimately held not to\nbe obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party.\n73\nSource: REVOLUTION MEDICINES, INC., S-1, [DATE]\n--  --\n14.4 Mitigation of Loss.

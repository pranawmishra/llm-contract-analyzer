### Guidelines for Clause Identification:
1. **Termination Clauses**: Look for contract duration, notice period, breach consequences, procedures, effects.
2. **Confidentiality Clauses**: Look for proprietary info protection, non-disclosure obligations, duration, permitted disclosures, material return.
3. **Liability Clauses**: Look for limitation of liability, indemnification, damage caps, risk allocation, insurance.

### General Guidelines:
1. **Extract the complete clause**: Include the entire clause text, not just a summary
2. **Maintain original formatting**: Preserve the exact text as it appears in the contract
3. **Look for section headers**: Clauses often start with headers like "TERMINATION", "CONFIDENTIALITY", "LIABILITY", "INDEMNIFICATION"
4. **Check for multiple clauses**: A contract may have multiple termination, confidentiality, or liability clauses
5. **Be thorough**: Search through the entire document for relevant clauses
6. **Handle variations**: Look for similar terms like "Term and Termination", "Non-Disclosure", "Limitation of Liability", "Indemnification"
